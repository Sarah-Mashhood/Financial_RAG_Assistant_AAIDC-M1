Question:
What was the efficiency ratio in the last quarter?

Answer:
Based on the provided financial report, the efficiency ratio for the last quarter (January – March 2025) is not explicitly mentioned. However, we can calculate the efficiency ratio using the available information.

Efficiency ratio = (Operating profit / Total assets)

From the financial report, we know that the operating profit (before credit loss allowance and tax) for the quarter ended March 2025 is PKR 17,342 million.

The total assets for the quarter ended March 2025 are not explicitly mentioned, but we can use the total assets for the year ended December 2024, which is PKR 886,138,488.

Efficiency ratio = (17,342 million / 886,138,488) = 1.95%

So, the efficiency ratio for the last quarter (January – March 2025) is approximately 1.95%.
