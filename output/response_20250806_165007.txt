Question:
Report the total assets if available.

Answer:
Based on the provided financial report, the total assets are not explicitly stated. However, we can calculate the total assets by adding the following components:

* Advances-gross: PKR 244,535
* Advances-net: PKR 225,569
* Investments - net: PKR 562,943
* Deposits: PKR 725,616

Total Assets = PKR 244,535 + PKR 225,569 + PKR 562,943 + PKR 725,616 = PKR 1,758,663

So, the total assets are PKR 1,758,663.
